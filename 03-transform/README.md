# Work 03: Transformations, more than meets the eye!

## Due: Monday 03/02 8:00am

- Write code to work with transformation matrices:
  - create a translation matrix
  - create a scale matrix
  - create a rotation matrix about the x-axis
  - create a rotation matrix about the y-axis
  - create a rotation matrix about the z-axis
  - Note: The trig functions in python and c take radians as parameters, but you should assume degree input, make sure to convert or things wonâ€™t look right.
- Modify your main routine so that it keeps track of:
  - A single edge matrix
  - A single master transformation matrix
- Create a parser that will interpret a script to be used to draw an image.
  - Each command is a single word without spaces in it, and if it takes arguments, the line after will contain the arguments, separated by spaces. For example, a line of the file might look like this:

```plaintext
line
0 0 0 100 100 0
```

- Here is the full list of commands:
  - line: add a line to the point matrix - takes 6 arguemnts (x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1)
  - ident: set the transform matrix to the identity matrix
  - scale: create a scale matrix, then multiply the transform matrix by the scale matrix - takes 3 arguments (sx, sy, sz)
  - move: create a translation matrix, then multiply the transform matrix by the translation matrix - takes 3 arguments (tx, ty, tz)
  - rotate: create a rotation matrix, then multiply the transform matrix by the rotation matrix - takes 2 arguments (axis theta)
  - apply: apply the current transformation matrix to the edge matrix
  - display: clear the screen, draw the lines of the point matrix to the screen, display the screen
  - save: clear the screen, draw the lines of the point matrix to the screen/frame save the screen/frame to a file - takes 1 argument (file name)
- The included script tests the various transformations, it should be used when I run make. You still need to create your own image and submit it to the gallery. Please include your script code only when you upload code to the gallery, this way it will be easy for others to try out your pictures!
