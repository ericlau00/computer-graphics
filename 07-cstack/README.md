# Work 07: Let's see how your code stacks up to the competition

Note: If you are working in c, I have provided a basic stack library that you can use in the 66source repository

Time to implement a relative coordinate system… system, add/modify your current parser so it has the following behavior

- `push`
  - Push a copy of the current top of the coordinate system (cs) stack onto the cs stack (a full copy, not just a reference to the current top… I’m looking at you python people)
- `pop`
  - Removes the top of the cs stack (nothing needs to be done with this data)
- `move`/ `rotate`/ `scale`

  1. create a translation/rotation/scale matrix
  2. multiply the current top of the cs stack by it
  3. The ordering of multiplication is important here. (see notes)

- `box`/ `sphere`/ `torus`

  1. add a box/sphere/torus to a temporary polygon matrix
  2. multiply it by the current top of the cs stack
  3. draw it to the screen
  4. clear the polygon matrix

- `line`/ `curve` / `circle`

  1. add a line to a temporary edge matrix
  2. multiply it by the current top
  3. draw it to the screen (note a line is not a solid, so avoid draw_polygons)

- `save`
  - save the screen with the provided file name

- `display`
  - show the image

- Also note that the `ident`, `apply` and `clear` commands no longer have any use
